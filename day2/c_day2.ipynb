    "* Allow players to choose to play again after completing a round. Using a `struct`, keep track of how many wins, losses, and draws each player has and display this information after each round.\n",
    "* Allow players to choose the board size at runtime. For example, `./tictactoe 5` would play on a 5x5 board. Note that although it is possible to declare variable length arrays on the stack, you should consider using the `malloc()` function to allocate on the heap instead in case the array is too large for the stack. A convenient way to do this for a square board of size `m` is with `int (*board)[m][m] = malloc(sizeof *board);` This declares `board` as a pointer to an m x m 2D array of integers, and then allocates enough heap memory to store an array of that size and sets `board` to point to that memory. Note that the type of `*board` is `int[m][m]`, so `sizeof *board` returns the size of m^2 `int`s. Don't forget to call `free()` when you're finished with the memory you allocated!"
